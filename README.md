## Transfer LearningÂ¶
In this notebook, we will perform transfer learning to train CIFAR-10 dataset on VGG16 model available in Keras.

The [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset contains 60,000 color images of 32 x 32 pixels in 3 channels divided into 10 classes. Each class contains 6,000 images. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the test sets provides 10,000 images. This is a classification problem with 10 classes(muti-label classification).
